# LED Blinking Patterns
This project demonstrates different LED control patterns using the 8051 microcontroller and Embedded C.
It includes:
Single LED blink
Sequential LED blinking (one by one)
LED scrolling effect (left-to-right / right-to-left)
Implemented using Keil uVision for coding and Proteus for simulation, these programs help understand GPIO control, delay generation, and basic pattern logic in embedded systems.
